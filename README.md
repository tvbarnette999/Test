# Test
Currently testing the linguist documentation git attribute by having an html file in the docs folder, and an html, c, and java file of the same size outside of the folder. It the attribute works, th elanguage %s should be very close to equal. Since the html in the docs is 1.5x the size of the other 3, if it doesnt work, HTML % should be much higher.
